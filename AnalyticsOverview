# Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - HIPAA/HITRUST Health Data and AI

## Overview

**The Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - HIPAA/HITRUST Health Data and AI offers a turn-key deployment of
an Azure PaaS solution to demonstrate how to securely ingest, store, 
analyze, and interact with health data while being able to meet industry
compliance requirements. The blueprint helps accelerate cloud adoption
and utilization for customers with data that is regulated.**

The Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - HIPAA/HITRUST Health Data and AI Blueprint provides tools and guidance to help
deploy a secure,  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) ready platform-as-a-service
(PaaS) environment for ingesting, storing, analyzing, and interacting
with personal and non-personal medical records in a secure,
multi-tier cloud environment, deployed as an end-to-end solution. It
showcases a common reference architecture and is designed to simplify
adoption of Microsoft Azure. This provided architecture illustrates a
 solution to meet the needs of organizations seeking a
cloud-based approach to reducing the burden and cost of deployment.

![](images/components.png)

The solution is designed to consume a sample data set formatted using
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), a worldwide standard
for exchanging healthcare information electronically, and store it in a
secure manner. Customers can then use Azure Machine Learning to take
advantage of powerful business intelligence tools and analytics to
review predictions made on the sample data. As an example of the kind of
experiment Azure Machine Learning can facilitate, the blueprint includes
a sample dataset, scripts, and tools for predicting the length of a 
patient's stay in a hospital facility. 

This blueprint is intended to serve as a modular foundation for customers 
to adjust to their specific requirements, developing new Azure Machine 
learning experiments to solve both clinical and operational use case scenarios. 
It is designed to be secure and compliant when deployed; however, customers are responsible for
configuring roles correctly and implementing any modifications. Note the following:

-   This blueprint provides a baseline to help customers use Microsoft
    Azure in a HITRUST, and HIPAA environment.

-   Although the blueprint was designed to be aligned with 
HIPAA and HITRUST (through the Common Security Framework
    -- CSF), it should not be considered compliant until certified by an
    external auditor per HIPAA and HITRUST certification requirements.

-   Customers are responsible for conducting appropriate security and
    compliance reviews of any solution built using this foundational
    architecture.

## Deploying the automation

- To deploy the solution, follow the instructions provided in the deployment guidance. 

[![](./images/deploy.png)](https://aka.ms/healthblueprintdeploy)

For a quick overview of how this solution works, watch this [video](https://aka.ms/healthblueprintvideo) explaining and demonstrating its deployment.

- Frequently asked question can be found in the [FAQ](https://aka.ms/healthblueprintfaq) guidance.

-   **Architectural diagram.** The diagram shows the reference
    architecture used for the blueprint and the example use case scenario.

-   **Deployment templates**. In this deployment, [Azure Resource
    Manager
    templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#template-deployment)
    are used to automatically deploy the components of the architecture
    into Microsoft Azure by specifying configuration parameters during
    setup.

-   **[Automated deployment scripts](https://aka.ms/healthblueprintdeploy)**. These scripts help deploy the
     solution. The scripts consist of:


-   A module installation and [global
    administrator](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal)
    setup script is used to install and verify that required PowerShell
    modules and global administrator roles are configured correctly. 
-   An installation PowerShell script is used to deploy the 
    solution, provided via a .zip file that contains a pre-built
    demo functions.

## Solution components


The foundational architecture is composed of the following components:

-   **[Threat model](https://aka.ms/healththreatmodel)** A comprehensive threat model is provided in tm7
    format for use with the [Microsoft Threat Modeling
    Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49168),
    showing the components of the solution, the data flows between them,
    and the trust boundaries. The model can help customers understand
    the points of potential risk in the system infrastructure when
    developing machine learning components or other modifications.

-   **[Customer implementation matrix](https://aka.ms/healthcrmblueprint)** A Microsoft Excel workbook lists
    the relevant HITRUST requirements and explains how Microsoft and the
    customer are responsible for meeting each one.

-   **[Health review.](https://aka.ms/healthreviewpaper)** The solution was reviewed by Coalfire systems, Inc. The Health Compliance (HIPAA, and HITRUST)
    Review and guidance for implementation provides an auditor\'s review
    of the solution, and considerations for transforming the blueprint
    to a production-ready deployment.

## Roles


The blueprint defines two roles for administrative users (operators),
and three roles for users in hospital management and patient care. A
sixth role is defined for an auditor to evaluate compliance with HIPAA
and other regulations. Azure Role-based Access Control (RBAC) enables
precisely focused access management for each user of the solution
through built-in and custom roles. See [Get started with Role-Based
Access Control in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-what-is)
and [Built-in roles for Azure role-based access
control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles)

## Example Use case


The example use case included with this blueprint illustrates how the 
 Blueprint can be used to enable machine learning and
analytics on health data in the cloud. Contosoclinic is a small
hospital located in the United States. The hospital network
administrators want to use Azure Machine Learning to better predict the
length of a patient's stay at the time of admittance, in order to
increase operational workload efficiency, and enhance the quality of care
it can provide.

### Predicting length of stay


The example use case scenario uses Azure Machine Learning to predict a newly
admitted patient's length of stay by comparing the medical details taken
at patient intake to aggregated historical data from previous patients.
The blueprint includes a large set of anonymized medical records to
demonstrate the training and predictive capabilities of the solution. In
a production deployment, customers would use their own records to train
the solution for more accurate predictions reflecting the unique details
of their environment, facilities, and patients.

# Design configuration


This section details the default configurations and security measures
built into the Blueprint outlined to:

- **INGEST** data raw sources including FHIR data source
- **STORE**  sensitive information
- **ANALYZE** and predict outcomes
- **INTERACT** with the results and predictions
- **IDENTITY** management of solution
- **SECURITY** enabled features


## IDENTITY 

### Azure Active Directory and role-based access control (RBAC)


**Authentication:**

-   [Azure Active Directory (Azure
    AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) is the
    Microsoft\'s multi-tenant cloud-based directory and identity
    management service. All users for the solution were created in Azure
    Active Directory, including users accessing the SQL Database.



-   Authentication to the application is performed using Azure AD. For
    more information, see [Integrating applications with Azure Active
    Directory](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications).

-   [Azure Active Directory Identity
    Protection](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection)
    detects potential vulnerabilities affecting your organization's
    identities, configures automated responses to detected suspicious
    actions related to your organization's identities, and investigates
    suspicious incidents and takes appropriate action to resolve them.

-   [Azure Role-based Access Control
    (RBAC)](/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure)
    enables precisely focused access management for Azure. Subscription
    access is limited to the subscription administrator, and Azure Key
    Vault access is limited to the site administrator. Strong passwords
    (12 characters minimum with at least one Upper/Lower letter, number,
    and special character) are required.

-   Multi-factor authentication is supported when the -enableMFA switch is
    enabled during deployment.

-   Passwords expire after 60 days when the -enableADDomainPasswordPolicy
    switch is enabled during deployment.

**Roles:**

-   The solution makes use of [built-in
    roles](/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles)
    to manage access to resources.

-   All users are assigned specific built-in roles by default.

### Azure Key Vault

-   Data stored in Key Vault includes:

    -   Application insight key
    -   Patient Data Storage Access key
    -   Patient connection string
    -   Patient data table name
    -   Azure ML Web Service Endpoint
    -   Azure ML Service API Key

-   Advanced access policies are configured on a need basis
-   Key Vault access policies are defined with minimum required
    permissions to keys and secrets
-   All keys and secrets in Key Vault have expiration dates
-   All keys in Key Vault are protected by HSM \[Key Type = HSM
    Protected 2048-bit RSA Key\]
-   All users/identities are granted minimum required permissions using
    Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
-   Applications do not share a Key Vault unless they trust each other
    and they need access to the same secrets at runtime
-   Diagnostics logs for Key Vault are enabled with a retention period
    of at least 365 days.
-   Permitted cryptographic operations for keys are restricted to the
    ones required

## INGEST 

### Azure Functions
The solution was designed to  use [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/) to process the sample length of stay data used in the analytics demo. Three capabilities in the functions have been created.

**1. Bulk import of customer data phi data**

When using the demo script. .\\HealthcareDemo.ps1 with the **BulkPatientAdmission** switch as outlined in **Deploying and running the demo** it executes the following processing pipeline:
1. **Azure Blob Storage** - Patient data .csv file sample uploaded to storage
2. **Event Grid** - Event Publishes data to Azure Function (Bulk import - blob event)
3. **Azure Function** - Performs the processing and stores the data into SQL Storage using the secure function - event(type; blob url)
4. **SQL DB** - The database store for Patient Data using tags for classification, and the ML process is kicked off to do the training experiment.

![](images/dataflow.png)

Additionally the azure function was designed to read and protect designated sensitive data in the sample data set using the following tags:
- dataProfile => “ePHI”
- owner => \<Site Admin UPN\>
- environment => “Pilot”
- department => “Global Ecosystem"
The tagging was applied to the sample data set where patient 'names' was identified as clear text.

**2. Admission of new patients**

When using the demo script. .\\HealthcareDemo.ps1 with the **BulkPatientadmission** switch as outlined in **Deploying and running the demo** it executes the following processing pipeline:
![](images/securetransact.png)
**1. Azure Function** triggered and the function requests for a [bearer token](/rest/api/) from Azure Active directory.

**2. Key Vault** requested for a secret that is associated to the requested token.

**3. Azure Roles validate the request, and authorize access request to the Key Vault.

**4. Key Vault** returns the secret, in this case the SQL DB Connection string.

**5. Azure Function** uses the connection string to securely connect to SQL Database and continues further processing to store ePHI data.

To achieve the storage of the data, a common API schema was implemented  following Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, pronounced fire). The function was provided the following FHIR exchange elements:

-   [Patient schema](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) covers the "who" information about a patient.

-   [Observation schema](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html)  covers the central element in healthcare, used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns and even capture demographic characteristics. 

-   [Encounter schema](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html) covers the types of encounters such as ambulatory, emergency, home health, inpatient, and virtual encounters.

-   [Condition schema](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html) covers detailed information about a condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.  



### Event Grid


The solution supports Azure Event Grid, a single service for managing
routing of all events from any source to any destination, providing:

-   [Security and
    authentication](/azure/event-grid/security-authentication)

-   [Role-based access
    control](/azure/event-grid/security-authentication#management-access-control)
