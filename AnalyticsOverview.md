# Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint: Analytics for GDPR

## Overview
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is fundamentally about protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals.
The GDPR establishes strict global privacy requirements governing how you manage and protect personal data while respecting individual choice - no matter where data is sent, processed, or stored. Microsoft Azure services meet the stringent GDPR security requirements and Microsoft's contractual commitments guarantee that you can:
- Respond to requests to correct, amend or delete personal data.
- Detect and report personal data breaches.
- Demonstrate your compliance with the GDPR.

This Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint provides guidance for how to deliver a Microsoft Azure data warehouse architecture that helps organizations identify and catalog personal data in systems, build more secure environments, and simplify management of GDPR compliance. This solution provides guidance on the deployment and configuration of Azure resources for a common reference architecture, demonstrating ways in which customers can meet specific security and compliance requirements and serves as a foundation for customers to build and configure their own data warehouse solutions in Azure.

This reference architecture, associated control implementation guides, and threat models are intended to serve as a foundation for customers to adjust to their specific requirements and should not be used as-is in a production environment. Please note the following:
- The architecture provides a baseline to help customers deploy workloads to Azure in a GDPR-compliant manner.
- Customers are responsible for conducting appropriate security and compliance assessments of any solution built using this architecture, as requirements may vary based on the specifics of each customer's implementation.

## Architecture Diagram and Components
This solution uses the following Azure services. Details of the deployment architecture are in the [Deployment Architecture](#deployment-architecture) section.

- Availability Sets
  -	(1) Active Directory domain controllers


- Virtual Network
  -	(4) Subnets
  -	(4) Network Security Groups


- Azure Active Directory

- Azure Key Vault

- Operations Management Suite (OMS)

## Deployment Architecture

### **Discover**
**Identify which personal data exists and where it resides.**

A critical step to addressing GDPR requirements is to identify all personal data managed by the organization, so that they can adequately protect it and respond to data subject requests, such as erasure, rectification, and data portability.  

 **Azure Active Directory**: [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoftâ€™s multi-tenant, cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection into a single solution. Azure AD also offers a rich, standards-based platform that enables developers to deliver access control to their applications, based on centralized policy and rules.

Azure Active Directory enables administrators to search for user data, and then edit data associated with the user account.

**Azure Data Catalog**: [Azure Data Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-catalog/data-catalog-what-is-data-catalog) is a fully managed cloud service whose users can discover the data sources they need and understand the data sources they find. At the same time, Data Catalog helps organizations get more value from their existing investments.

### Manage
**Govern how personal data is used and accessed.**

Azure enables you to export your data at any time, without seeking approval from Microsoft. Azure Active Directory (AAD) enables you to export data associated with AAD accounts in a .csv file.

**Azure SQL Database**: [SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview) is a general-purpose relational database managed service in Microsoft Azure that supports structures such as relational data, JSON, spatial, and XML. SQL Database offers managed single SQL databases, managed SQL databases in an elastic pool, and SQL Managed Instances (in public preview). It delivers dynamically scalable performance and provides options such as columnstore indexes for extreme analytic analysis and reporting, and in-memory OLTP for extreme transactional processing. Microsoft handles all patching and updating of the SQL code base seamlessly and abstracts away all management of the underlying infrastructure.

Using SQL queries, Microsoft customers can correct inaccurate or incomplete data hosted in Azure SQL Database.

**Azure Monitor**
[Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/) is part of Microsoft Azure's overall monitoring solution. Azure Monitor helps you track performance, maintain security, and identify trends. Learn how to audit, create alerts, and archive data with our quickstarts and tutorials.

**Azure Machine Learning**
[Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/) services (preview) enable building, deploying, and managing machine learning and AI models using any Python tools and libraries. You can use a wide variety of data and compute services in Azure to store and process your data.

**Azure Functions**
[Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. Functions can make development even more productive, and you can use your development language of choice, such as C#, F#, Node.js, Java, or PHP. Pay only for the time your code runs and trust Azure to scale as needed. Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure.

**Azure Event Grid**
[Azure Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview) allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures. You select the Azure resource you would like to subscribe to, and give the event handler or WebHook endpoint to send the event to. Event Grid has built-in support for events coming from Azure services, like storage blobs and resource groups. Event Grid also has custom support for application and third-party events, using custom topics and custom webhooks.

#### **Virtual Network**
This reference architecture defines a private virtual network with an address space of 10.0.0.0/16.

**Network Security Groups**: [NSGs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg) contain Access Control Lists (ACLs) that allow or deny traffic within a VNet. NSGs can be used to secure traffic at a subnet or individual VM level. The following NSGs exist:
  -	An NSG for Active Directory

Each of the NSGs have specific ports and protocols open so that the solution can work securely and correctly. In addition, the following configurations are enabled for each NSG:
  -	[Diagnostic logs and events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-nsg-manage-log) are enabled and stored in a storage account
  -	OMS Log Analytics is connected to the [NSG's diagnostics](https://github.com/krnese/AzureDeploy/blob/master/AzureMgmt/AzureMonitor/nsgWithDiagnostics.json)

**Subnets**: Each subnet is associated with its corresponding NSG.

### **Protect**
**Establish security controls to prevent, detect, and respond to vulnerabilities and data breaches.**

The solution uses [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) for the management of keys and secrets. Azure Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets used by cloud applications and services.
- Advanced access policies are configured on a need basis
- Key Vault access policies are defined with minimum required permissions to keys and secrets
- All keys and secrets in Key Vault have expiration dates
- All keys in Key Vault are protected by HSM [Key Type = HSM Protected 2048-bit RSA Key]
- All users/identities are granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Diagnostics logs for Key Vault are enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days.
- Permitted cryptographic operations for keys are restricted to the ones required

#### **Data in Transit**
Azure encrypts all communications to and from Azure datacenters by default. All transactions to Azure Storage through the Azure Portal occur via HTTPS.

#### **Data at Rest**

The architecture protects data at rest through encryption, database auditing, and other measures.

**Azure Storage**
To meet encrypted data at rest requirements, all [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) uses [Storage Service Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption).

**Azure Disk Encryption**
[Azure Disk Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption) leverages the BitLocker feature of Windows to provide volume encryption for OS and data disks. The solution integrates with Azure Key Vault to help control and manage the disk-encryption keys.

**Azure SQL Database**
The Azure SQL Database instance uses the following database security measures:
-	[AD Authentication and Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication) enables identity management of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location.
-	[SQL database auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing-get-started) tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in an Azure storage account.
-	SQL Database is configured to use [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql), which performs real-time encryption and decryption of data and log files to protect information at rest. TDE provides assurance that stored data has not been subject to unauthorized access.
-	[Firewall rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure) prevent all access to database servers until proper permissions are granted. The firewall grants access to databases based on the originating IP address of each request.
-	[SQL Threat Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection-get-started) enables the detection and response to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts for suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, SQL injection attacks, and anomalous database access patterns.
-	[Always Encrypted columns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted-azure-key-vault) ensure that sensitive data never appears as plaintext inside the database system. After enabling data encryption, only client applications or app servers with access to the keys can access plaintext data.
-	[SQL Database Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started) limits sensitive data exposure by masking the data to non-privileged users or applications. DDM allows the database administrator to select a particular table-column that contains sensitive data, add a mask to it (there are a few available built-in masks that can be applied, as well as a customizable mask), and designate which database users are privileged and should have access to the real data. Once configured, any query on that table or column will contain masked results, except for queries run by privileged users. DDM can be done after the reference architecture deploys. **Note: Customers will need to adjust DDM settings to adhere to their database schema.**

**Azure Security Center**
[Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-intro) provides unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads. With Security Center, you can apply security policies across your workloads, limit your exposure to threats, and detect and respond to attacks.

### **Report**
**Keep required documentation and manage data requests and breach notifications.**

#### Logging and Auditing

[Operations Management Suite (OMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption) provides extensive logging of system and user activity, as well as system health. The OMS [Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/log-analytics/) solution collects and analyzes data generated by resources in Azure and on-premises environments.
- **Activity Logs**: [Activity logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-activity-logs) provide insight into operations performed on resources in a subscription.
- **Diagnostic Logs**: [Diagnostic logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs) include all logs emitted by every resource. These logs include Windows event system logs and Azure Blob storage, tables, and queue logs.
- **Firewall Logs**: The Application Gateway provides full diagnostic and access logs. Firewall logs are available for WAF-enabled Application Gateway resources.
- **Log Archiving**: All diagnostic logs write to a centralized and encrypted Azure storage account for archival with a defined retention period of 2 days. These logs connect to Azure Log Analytics for processing, storing, and dashboard reporting.

Additionally, the following OMS solutions are included as a part of this architecture:
-	[AD Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-ad-assessment): The Active Directory Health Check solution assesses the risk and health of server environments on a regular interval and provides a prioritized list of recommendations specific to the deployed server infrastructure.

## Compliance Documentation

## Guidance and Recommendations
### ExpressRoute and VPN
[ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or a secure VPN tunnel needs to be configured to securely establish a connection to the resources deployed as a part of this data warehouse reference architecture. As ExpressRoute connections do not go over the Internet, these connections offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet. By appropriately setting up ExpressRoute or a VPN, customers can add a layer of protection for data in transit.

### Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) Process
[PolyBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide) can load data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse without the need for a separate ETL or import tool. PolyBase allows access to data through T-SQL queries. Microsoft's business intelligence and analysis stack, as well as third-party tools compatible with SQL Server, can be used with PolyBase.

### Azure Active Directory Setup
[Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) is essential to managing the deployment and provisioning access to personnel interacting with the environment. An existing Windows Server Active Directory can be integrated with AAD in [four clicks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-express). Customers can also tie the deployed Active Directory infrastructure (domain controllers) to an existing AAD by making the deployed Active Directory infrastructure a subdomain of an AAD forest.
